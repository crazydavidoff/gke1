Use this directory as a reference for creating new namespaces:

1. Copy *sample-namespace* directory to a new one with the required name.
2. Edit the YAML definitions, replacing *sample-namespace* with the name of your namespace.
3. Edit the default namespace policies chart values to change the defaults according to your needs.
4. Create new resource definitions inside the directory. It is advised to create a new subdirectory for any installed application.
